I am the Director of the Atlantic Canada Center for Disease Ecology Modelling (ACCDMi). My research is in theoretical ecology, evolution and epidemiology. I make models of appropriate complexity, that consider the best available data, that answer meaningful questions, and where the results are interpreted and communicated appropriately. I want to help trainees learn the best approaches to data analysis in biology. In 2023, I was awarded the President’s Award for Distinguished Teaching. I am a senior editor at the Bulletin of Mathematical Biology. During my term as chair of the Equity, Diversity, Inclusion and Membership committee for the Canadian Applied and Industrial Mathematics Society, I authored this report.
