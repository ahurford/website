My research is in theoretical ecology, evolution and epidemiology. I make models of appropriate complexity, that consider the best available data, that answer meaningful questions, and where the results are interpreted and communicated appropriately. I want to help trainees learn the best approaches to data analysis in biology. I recently developed the MUN Biology BSc Quantitative Training Program together with Dr. Yolanda Wiersma. In 2023, I was awarded the President’s Award for Distinguished Teaching. In this CBC interview, I talk about the importance of infectious disease modelling training to support public health. I am a senior editor at the Bulletin of Mathematical Biology. I am chair of the Equity, Diversity, Inclusion and Membership committee for the Canadian Applied and Industrial Mathematics Society.

Publications", " Research My research is in population biology, mathematical modelling, evolutionary epidemiology, species range shifts, infectious diseases and public health. I am interested in the biological questions. I like to learn new mathematical frameworks, so there are fewer technical barriers to answering the questions I am interested in. COVID-19 modelling During the COVID-19 pandemic, we showed that travel restrictions reduced clinical COVID-19 cases in Newfoundland and Labrador by 92%. We analyzed Rapid Antigen Test results and found that in January 2022, 1 in 4.3 households positive for COVID-19 were captured in Newfoundland and Labrador provincial case counts. This under-reporting ratio is lower than for other Canadian provinces, and there are few data of this type for school-aged children in Canada. We developed a framework that extends importation modelling by considering characteristics of the local population, such as vaccination status and non-pharmaceutical interventions. This framework can be used to inform re-opening policies in regions implementing an elimination strategy, where few such frameworks currently exist. I have been quoted in the British Medical Journal, the New York Times, the Globe and Mail, and local media such as NTV, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, and The Telegram. I appeared in a Fields Institute Panel. I was lead organizer for the AARMS-EIDM Summer School in Modelling Infectious Diseases. What next? In 1997, cross-fertilization of ideas between population biology and epidemiology was described. Given the need for modelling in public health, as highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the skills of population biologists, we need to work to bring these fields closer together. When working in human health, mathematical modellers need to do better considering health equity; or alternatively, do better in explaining the data or computational limitations that are barriers to doing so. Mathematical modellers need to give better guidance regarding which modelling approaches are best for what questions. At present, it is very easy to learn to code without any training in modelling to learn the different types of models. When you only have a hammer, everything looks like a nail. Inevitably, this approach will produce bad results for some questions. We need to develop mathematical modelling frameworks that can recommend elimination strategies. We should work for more synergy between data science and science, and machine learning, statistics, and mechanistic modelling approaches.

If you are interested in becoming a graduate student or postdoctoral fellow in my lab, please watch the Society for Mathematical Biology Forum, the Theoretical Ecology Wiki for the Ecological Society of America, IDDjobs and the Canadian Society for Ecology and Evolution job listings, where I will advertise available positions during the month of October. MSc, PhD, and postdoctoral fellowship positions in population dynamics and infectious disease modelling - Memorial University, St. John’s, Newfoundland and Labrador The Populations+ research group led by Dr. Amy Hurford at Memorial University (St. John’s, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada) is recruiting MSc, PhD, and postdoctoral fellows with an interest in population dynamics or modelling infectious diseases. Research projects might consider the impact of climate change on infectious disease, population dynamics, animal and human movement, infectious disease models for decision support and health equity, and strategies for infectious disease control including during pandemics. All projects are to be data-driven, and prospective students should be interested in developing, implementing, and analyzing models that make practical recommendations for decision support. Suitable candidates should have expertise in at least one of: modelling; applied mathematics; data science; biology; epidemiology; or public health, and have strong interest in highly interdisciplinary science and modelling. Salaries for graduate students will be above the university-determined minimum values (Biology and Interdisciplinary studies) and are based on the recommendations of Support our Science. The salary offer does not include tuition (for amounts see Biology and Interdisciplinary studies). Funds will be available for conference and workshop participation. The Populations+ group maintains a network of mathematical biology collaborators throughout Canada, and trainees are encouraged to participate in activities to build and support their professional development. The Population+ group is located in the Biology Department at Memorial University in St. John’s, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, with research space in the Core Sciences Facility, a state-of-the-art facility completed in September 2021. To apply please complete the application form. For full consideration please complete your application by December 1. Applications submitted after this date will be considered if the positions are not filled. Please contact Dr. Amy Hurford (ahurford@mun.ca) with any questions. Individuals that are members of underrepresented groups are particularly encouraged to apply, and contact Dr. Hurford with any questions.
