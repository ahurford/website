[["research.html", "Research", " Research I am a mathematical biologist. My research considers: Public health responses to COVID-19 in Atlantic Canada; Population dynamics with temperature dependence and explicit space; and Evolutionary epidemiology. For my publications, see Google Scholar Our COVID-19 research has shown: Travel restrictions and the Omicron variant Newfoundland and Labrador’s travel restrictions decreased the number of COVID-19 cases in the province by 92%. Testing to detect and quickly respond to clusters should be prioritized over increasing contact tracing capacity in populations that are highly vaccinated. Members of the mobile workforce should be prioritized for vaccination in regions, such as NL, without community spread. Don’t wait, re-escalate: using mathematics accessible to university students, we show that delayed restrictions need to have longer duration to achieve the same endpoint. In fall 2020, elementary school children return unvaccinated. How does the impact of one infectious student staying at home compare for elementary schools and high schools, where a high proportion of students are vaccinated? I am a member of the Emerging Infectious Disease Modelling Consortium, in the CANMOD, Mathematics for Public Health, and One Health Networks. I am an external expert for PHAC’s modelling group, and a member of the modelling special advisory group for the COVID Immunity Taskforce. I have provided modelling support to the Newfoundland and Labrador government throughout the pandemic. Prospective students I am always looking to support graduate students with a strong interest in mathematical biology, who are interested in deriving, analyzing, parameterizing and validating dynamical systems models in ecology and epidemiology. If you are interested in becoming a graduate student in my lab, please identify some of my publications that are of interest to you, and how these relate to your future research interests. Please send me an email describing your qualifications and interests.
