My research is in theoretical ecology, evolution and epidemiology. Over the last 20 years, I have learned modelling working with, and reading the work of, some outstanding scientists. I try to make models of appropriate complexity, that consider the best available data, that answer meaningful questions, and where the results are interpreted and communicated appropriately. I want to help trainees learn the best approaches to data analysis in biology. I recently developed the MUN Biology BSc Quantitative Training Program together with Dr. Yolanda Wiersma. I am a senior editor at the Bulletin of Mathematical Biology. In 2022, I was awarded the Faculty of Science Distinguished Teaching Award. I maintain a repository of equity, diversity and inclusion resources for the Canadian Applied and Industrial Mathematics Society.

When populations move north but disease moves south: counterintuitive impacts of climate change on disease spread COVID-19 We worked during the COVID-19 pandemic to provide modelling support to the emergency response. Not everything we did will end-up being published, so I will archive some of this below. A challenging aspect of modelling COVID-19 in Newfoundland and Labrador was needing a modelling framework that was appropriate to answer public health questions when the importation risk was high, but there were no community cases. I am happy with what we came up with, and it is described here: Pandemic modelling for regions implementing an elimination strategy I worked with Steve Walker to use McMasterPandemic to forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations in Newfoundland and Labrador. Thanks to the authors of this software. (Highlighted in the New York Times) Some of our early work: Newfoundland and Labrador’s travel restrictions. Related interview with CBC On The Go “The elimination strategy is most likely appropriate in specific locations and for specific periods of time as the costs and benefits of the strategy likely depend on complex interactions between regional characteristics, public health policy, community behavioural responses, and variant epidemiological characteristics.” — Hurford et al. 2023. Here’s a few more key pieces on that same point: Travel restrictions and the Omicron variant. See also British Medical Journal article by Andrew Silver. It is not realistic to eliminate COVID-19 in Newfoundland and Labrador. Here’s why. This article is led by Dr. Maria Martignoni. For methods, see here.
