COVID-19 modelling During the COVID-19 pandemic my research program involved infectious disease modelling to support the government of Newfoundland and Labrador. I have been quoted in the British Medical Journal, the New York Times, the Globe and Mail, and local media such as NTV, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, and The Telegram. Peer-reviewed publications that support these statements of expert opinion are: Hurford et al. 2021. Modelling the impact of travel restrictions on COVID-19 cases in Newfoundland and Labrador Hurford et al. 2023. Pandemic modelling for regions implementing an elimination strategy Martignoni et al. 2023. Extensive SARS-CoV-2 testing reveals BA.1/BA.2 asymptomatic rates and underreporting in school children Martignoni et al. 2022. Rotational worker vaccination provides indirect protection to vulnerable groups in regions with low COVID-19 prevalence Martignoni et al. 2022. Downsizing of COVID-19 contact tracing in highly immune populations Hurford and Watmough, 2021. Don’t Wait, Re-escalate: Delayed Action Results in Longer Duration of COVID-19 Restrictions Xia et al. Canada’s Provincial Covid-19 Pandemic Modelling Efforts: A Review of Mathematical Models and Their Impacts on the Responses (under review) My research group continues to do modelling to support future pandemic preparedness, and to support regions that implement an elimination strategy. I appeared in a Fields Institute Panel. I was lead organizer for the AARMS-EIDM Summer School in Modelling Infectious Diseases. Publications For my publications, see Google Scholar.
