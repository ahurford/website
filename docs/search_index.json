My research is in theoretical ecology, evolution and epidemiology. I make models of appropriate complexity, that consider the best available data, that answer meaningful questions, and where the results are interpreted and communicated appropriately. I want to help trainees learn the best approaches to data analysis in biology. I recently developed the MUN Biology BSc Quantitative Training Program together with Dr. Yolanda Wiersma. In 2022, I was awarded the Faculty of Science Distinguished Teaching Award. In this interview with CBC’s Bernice Hillier, I talk about the importance of infectious disease modelling training to support public health. I am a senior editor at the Bulletin of Mathematical Biology. I am chair of the Equity, Diversity, Inclusion and Membership committee for the Canadian Applied and Industrial Mathematics Society.
