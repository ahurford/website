My research is in theoretical ecology, evolution and epidemiology. I make models of appropriate complexity, that consider the best available data, that answer meaningful questions, and where the results are interpreted and communicated appropriately. I want to help trainees learn the best approaches to data analysis in biology. I recently developed the MUN Biology BSc Quantitative Training Program together with Dr. Yolanda Wiersma. In 2023, I was awarded the President’s Award for Distinguished Teaching. In this CBC interview, I talk about the importance of infectious disease modelling training to support public health. I am a senior editor at the Bulletin of Mathematical Biology. I am chair of the Equity, Diversity, Inclusion and Membership committee for the Canadian Applied and Industrial Mathematics Society.

I am interested in the biological questions. I like to learn new mathematical frameworks, so there are fewer technical barriers to answering the biological questions I am interested in. I have made models that are delay differential equations, partial differential equations, integrodifference equations, non-autonomous ordinary differential equations, branching process models, and models that use optimal control. I aim to not to be limited in the questions that I can answer, by the models that I know. I like to develop new methods rather than use off-the-shelf approaches. Our modelling during COVID-19 Our modelling work during the COVID-19 pandemic began with a technical report that was included in witness testimony when travel measures implemented under the public health emergency were challenged in provincial court. Our technical report showed that travel measures reduced clinical COVID-19 cases in Newfoundland and Labrador by 92%. This work is now peer-reviewed, published, and cited in a World Health Organization report for the Western Pacific Region. The travel measures remained in place after the court decision, and subsequently during the COVID-19 pandemic, Newfoundland and Labrador implemented a containment strategy. Most SARS-CoV-2 infections were reported in travelers and were contained without spread to members of the Newfoundland and Labrador community. This lack of community spread meant that classic models such as Susceptible-Infected-Recovered, and widely-adopted methodologies for calculating dynamic reproduction numbers in partially-immune populations, were not appropriate. We needed to develop novel methodologies to assess the effectiveness of public health measures, and the capacity to relax measures given increasing vaccination levels in the Newfoundland and Labrador community. This work is peer-reviewed and published in this theme issue on Modelling COVID-19 and Preparedness for Future Pandemics. The technical annex to a World Health Organization update (July 2021) establishes regional factors as considerations to determine whether travel measures are appropriate (see bullet points at the bottom of p2). Our accepted publication describes regional considerations that determine whether an elimination strategy is appropriate, where implementing an elimination strategy potentially requires implementing travel restrictions. Particularly, we emphasize that the recommended strategy, elimination or mitigation, may not be the same for all Canadian jurisdictions. This work is to appear in the Royal Society Open Science, Science, Society, and Policy collection. International Advisory Board members for this collection include Professor Mona Nemer, Chief Science Adviser to the Prime Minister of Canada. Some of our COVID-19 work is ongoing. We have completed an analysis of the travel declaration forms submitted by non-residents during the public health emergency. We analyzed the results of Rapid Antigen Tests to understand under-reporting, and inform some of our ongoing modelling. We are analyzing contact tracing data, and we continue to work to advance mathematical modelling methodologies to support the needs of Canadian small jurisdictions. I have been quoted in the British Medical Journal, the New York Times, the Globe and Mail, and local media such as NTV, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, and The Telegram. I appeared in a Fields Institute Panel. I was lead organizer for the AARMS-EIDM Summer School in Modelling Infectious Diseases. Research after COVID-19 I am a population biologist, and population biologists know how to model infectious disease spread. My best ideas come from population biology, and the connections between the two fields are well-noted. We had worked on Arctic rabies prior to the pandemic, but just recently I was reminded of the atto-fox. These problems related to subsequent waves of infection caused by a fractional number of individuals, were central to our recent work explaining common misconceptions that bias against elimination strategy recommendations, and is another example of advances in population biology informing infectious disease modelling. Generally, I just love mathematical modelling. Models are the power that answer questions. I like to develop models to fit to data, to estimate key parameters, and to resolve unknown, implicit, critical assumptions. I like to develop theory that demonstrates the power of mechanistic mathematical models in data analysis. It is important to understand the general dynamics of models. My immediate thoughts when I see time-series data are “what types of models, and interacting biological processes, could give rise to these data?” I like to study the full range of model dynamics to be able to answer that question. Our past work has considered adding in physiology, and temperature dependence, to describe seasonal population dynamics and species ranges shifts in response to climate warming. We have integrated dispersal, movement, and genetic diversity into population dynamic models to describe spatial dynamics and trait evolution. Our work has applications to salmon parasites, tiny clams, rabies, Avian influenza, drug resistance in hospitals, SARS-CoV-2, bumblebees, wolves, moths, butterflies, fish, and hepatitis C.

If you are interested in becoming a graduate student or postdoctoral fellow in my lab, please watch the Society for Mathematical Biology Forum, the Theoretical Ecology Wiki for the Ecological Society of America, IDDjobs and the Canadian Society for Ecology and Evolution job listings, where I will advertise available positions during the month of October. Prospective students and trainees MSc, PhD, and postdoctoral fellowship positions in population dynamics and infectious disease modelling - Memorial University, St. John’s, Newfoundland and Labrador The Populations+ research group led by Dr. Amy Hurford at Memorial University (St. John’s, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada) is recruiting MSc, PhD, and postdoctoral fellows with an interest in population dynamics or modelling infectious diseases. Research projects might consider the impact of climate change on infectious disease, population dynamics, animal and human movement, infectious disease models for decision support and health equity, and strategies for infectious disease control including during pandemics. All projects are to be data-driven, and prospective students should be interested in developing, implementing, and analyzing models that make practical recommendations for decision support. Suitable candidates should have expertise in at least one of: modelling; applied mathematics; data science; biology; epidemiology; or public health, and have strong interest in highly interdisciplinary science and modelling. Salaries for graduate students will be above the university-determined minimum values (Biology and Interdisciplinary studies) and are based on the recommendations of Support our Science.
