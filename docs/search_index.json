My research is in theoretical ecology, evolution and epidemiology (including COVID-19). I recently developed the MUN Biology BSc Quantitative Training Program together with Dr. Yolanda Wiersma.

My research considers: Public health responses to COVID-19 in Atlantic Canada; Population dynamics with temperature dependence and explicit space; and Evolutionary epidemiology. For my publications, see Google Scholar Our COVID-19 research: Return to school rapid antigen testing in Newfoundland and Labrador (preliminary report) We used the results of 4122 rapid antigen tests performed on January 22 and 25 to estimate that 2.7% of K-12 students in Newfoundland and Labrador were infected with COVID-19. Omicron making like difficult for mathematicians trying to track COVID-19 Globe and Mail article by Sarah Smellie. See here for a related radio interview. Newfoundland and Labrador Omicron wave Datahub Graphs and analysis of the data reported in the NL Public Service Announcements. Synthesizes information reported over multiple days to contextualize with reported Omicron severity for other jurisdictions. Travel restrictions and the Omicron variant A decision-tree describing when travel restrictions are warranted. In smaller jurisdictions the conditions for the implementation of travel restrictions are more likely satisfied. Newfoundland and Labrador’s travel restrictions decreased the number of COVID-19 cases in the province by 92%. Related interview with CBC On The Go is here Testing to detect and quickly respond to clusters should be prioritized over increasing contact tracing capacity in populations that are highly vaccinated. Members of the mobile workforce should be prioritized for vaccination in regions, such as NL, without community spread. Don’t wait, re-escalate: using mathematics accessible to university students, we show that delayed restrictions need to have longer duration to achieve the same endpoint. In fall 2020, elementary school children return unvaccinated. How does the impact of one infectious student staying at home compare for elementary schools and high schools, where a high proportion of students are vaccinated?

I am an external expert for PHAC’s modelling group, and a member of the modelling special advisory group for the COVID Immunity Taskforce. I have provided modelling support to the Newfoundland and Labrador government throughout the pandemic. Prospective students I am always looking to support graduate students with a strong interest in mathematical biology, who are interested in deriving, analyzing, parameterizing and validating dynamical systems models in ecology and epidemiology. If you are interested in becoming a graduate student in my lab, please identify some of my publications that are of interest to you, and how these relate to your future research interests. Please send me an email describing your qualifications and interests.

Sheshatshiu Innu School returned to school after January 25 and, as such, are outside the scope of this study which aims to estimate infection prevalence on January 22 and 25 in K-12 students. More details on why these data matter Data informs the science, that informs the policy and decisions, that effect us all. Important decisions should be guided by high-quality evidence. A community-based initiative allows for reporting of rapid antigen tests in schools. The provincial government plans to provide submission portal for positive rapid antigen test results. All these initiatives, in addition to this research project, are valuable, and these initiatives are distinctly different and serve different purposes. This research project is designed to quantify the number of undetected Omicron cases. This objective is best met as research-led initiative. The impact of reopening is critically dependent on the number of people with recent infection. See Slide 10 of the Ontario Science Table’s projections released February 1. Estimating the number of people with recent infections is challenging without a reliable estimate of case counts. For Newfoundland and Labrador, the rapid antigen test results from K-12 students January 22 and 25 are valuable to compare with the provincially reported PCR counts from that time to understand the reliability of the daily case count updates. PCR testing eligibility in many provinces has prioritized older age groups (i.e. Nova Scotia). The K-12 rapid antigen test results are valuable as younger age groups have been less tested during the Omicron wave. "]]
