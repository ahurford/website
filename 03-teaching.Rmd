## MATH 1006: Calculus for the Life Sciences {-}

Bachelor's of Science students may complete _MATH 1006: Calculus for the Life Sciences_ to satisfy the core requirement for [6 credit hours](https://www.mun.ca/university-calendar/st-johns-campus/faculty-of-science/4/3/) in mathematics or statistics. [MATH 1000](https://www.mun.ca/university-calendar/st-johns-campus/faculty-of-science/13/9/) and _MATH 1006_ are credit restricted, and both are suitable pre-requisites for [MATH 1001: Calculus II](https://www.mun.ca/university-calendar/st-johns-campus/faculty-of-science/13/9/). These calendar changes have been approved, and will appear in the 2024-2025 University Calendar.


For a tentative MATH 1006 syllabus and content comparison to MATH 1000, see [here](https://github.com/ahurford/website/blob/main/MATH_1006.pdf).
