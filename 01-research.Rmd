# Research {-}

I am a mathematical biologist. My research considers:

(1) Public health responses to COVID-19 in Atlantic Canada;

(2) Population dynamics with temperature dependence and explicit space; and

(3) Evolutionary epidemiology.

<strong> Our COVID-19 research: </strong>

- [**Omicron making like difficult for mathematicians trying to track COVID-19**](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-omicron-making-life-difficult-for-mathematicians-trying-to-track-covid/?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter) Globe and Mail article by Sarah Smellie.
See [here](https://omny.fm/shows/alan-carter/omicron-making-life-difficult-for-mathematicians-t) for a related radio interview.

- [**Newfoundland and Labrador Omicron wave Datahub**](https://ahurford.github.io/covid-nl/) Graphs and analysis of the data reported in the NL Public Service Announcements. Synthesizes information reported over multiple days to contextualize with reported Omicron severity for other jurisdictions.

- [**Travel restrictions and the Omicron variant**](https://canmod.net/public-health#omicron-travel) A decision-tree describing when travel restrictions are warranted. In smaller jurisdictions the conditions for the implementation of travel restrictions are more likely satisfied.

- [**Newfoundland and Labrador's travel restrictions**](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.202266) decreased the number of COVID-19 cases in the province by 92%. Related interview with CBC On The Go is [here](https://www.cbc.ca/listen/live-radio/1-47-on-the-go/clip/15850405-research-royal-society-shows-nl-travel-restrictions-effective)

- [**Testing to detect and quickly respond to clusters**](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.03.21265863v1) should be prioritized over increasing contact tracing capacity in populations that are highly vaccinated.

- [**Members of the mobile workforce should be prioritized**](http://www.aimspress.com/article/doi/10.3934/math.2022220) for vaccination in regions, such as NL, without community spread.

- [**Don't wait, re-escalate:**](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.04.20226316v3) using mathematics accessible to university students, we show that delayed restrictions need to have longer duration to achieve the same endpoint.

- [**In fall 2020, elementary school children return unvaccinated.**](https://ahurford.github.io/schools/) How does the impact of one infectious student staying at home compare for elementary schools and high schools, where a high proportion of students are vaccinated?

- [**Scenario modelling to characterize the potential impact of Variants of Concern on COVID-19 epidemiology in Newfoundland and Labrador**](https://nccid.ca/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/Modelling-Group-executive-summary-2021_01_28_NCCID.pdf) Report that appeared in the Public Health Agency of Canada's Modelling Report, January 28, 2021.

I am a member of the Emerging Infectious Disease Modelling Consortium, in the [CANMOD](https://canmod.net/), [Mathematics for Public Health](http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/activities/public-health), and [One Health](https://www.yorku.ca/science/cdm/2021/04/09/ccdm-network-to-model-emerging-infectious-diseases-receives-2-5-million-in-federal-funding/) Networks. I am an external expert for PHAC's modelling group, and a member of the modelling special advisory group for the COVID Immunity Taskforce. I have provided modelling support to the Newfoundland and Labrador government throughout the pandemic.

### Prospective students {-}

I am always looking to support graduate students with a strong interest in mathematical biology, who are interested in deriving, analyzing, parameterizing and validating dynamical systems models in ecology and epidemiology.

If you are interested in becoming a graduate student in my lab, please identify some of my publications that are of interest to you, and how these relate to your future research interests. Please send me an email describing your qualifications and interests.
