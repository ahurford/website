# Research {-}

I am a mathematical biologist. My research considers:

(1) Public health responses to COVID-19 in Atlantic Canada;

(2) Population dynamics with temperature dependence and explicit space; and

(3) Evolutionary epidemiology.

<strong> OUR COVID-19 RESEARCH </strong>


**<u>Recommendations for implementing an effective elimination strategy during a pandemic</u>**

- [**Pandemic planning for regions implementing an elmination strategy**](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.18.22277695v1) shows that the risk of a community outbreak beginning in Newfoundland and Labrador was near one by the end of December 2021, and twice as high as the previous high in September 2021.

- [**Newfoundland and Labrador's travel restrictions**](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.202266) decreased the number of COVID-19 cases in the province by 92%. This is a peer-reviewed publication. Related interview with CBC On The Go is [here](https://www.cbc.ca/listen/live-radio/1-47-on-the-go/clip/15850405-research-royal-society-shows-nl-travel-restrictions-effective)

- [**Don't wait, re-escalate:**](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.04.20226316v3) using mathematics accessible to university students, we show that delayed restrictions need to have longer duration to achieve the same endpoint. Together with travel restrictions, implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions to reduce community spread is the second component of an elimination strategy. This is a peer-reviewed book chapter that appears in [Mathematics of Public Health](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-85053-1).


- [**Scenario modelling to characterize the potential impact of Variants of Concern on COVID-19 epidemiology in Newfoundland and Labrador**](https://nccid.ca/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/Modelling-Group-executive-summary-2021_01_28_NCCID.pdf) Report that appeared in the Public Health Agency of Canada's Modelling Report, January 28, 2021. Newfoundland and Labrador's elimination strategy was challenged by an alpha variant outbreak in February 2021.


**<u>Recommendations for exiting an elimination strategy</u>**

- [**Members of the mobile workforce should be prioritized**](http://www.aimspress.com/article/doi/10.3934/math.2022220) for vaccination in regions, such as Newfoundland and Labrador, without community spread. In this peer-reviewed publication, we describe vaccine priority groups for a Canadian province that pursued an elimination strategy.

- [**Downscaling contact tracing in populations that are highly vaccinated and have pursued an elimination strategy.**](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0268586) This peer-reviewed publication provides guidance for exiting an elimination strategy in highly vaccinated populations. Early detection should be prioritized over increasing contact tracing capacity. The emergence of highly transmissible viral variants may eliminate or reduce the possibility of downscaling contract tracing.

- [**Travel restrictions and the Omicron variant**](https://canmod.net/public-health#omicron-travel) A decision-tree describing when travel restrictions are warranted. In smaller jurisdictions the conditions for the implementation of travel restrictions are more likely satisfied. For further comments on travel restrictions and variants see this [British Medical Journal](https://www.bmj.com/content/377/bmj.o994) article by Andrew Silver.

- [**It is not realistic to eliminate COVID-19 in Newfoundland and Labrador. Here's why**](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/covid-19-here-to-stay-1.6384033). This article lead by Dr. Maria Martignoni is part of our work to provide recommendations for how, and when, to exit an elimination strategy. For methods, see [here](https://github.com/nanomaria/Omicronmitigation/blob/main/Methods.pdf).

**<u>Newfoundland and Labrador situational awareness during the Omicron wave</u>**

- [**Return to school rapid antigen testing in Newfoundland and Labrador (preliminary report)**](https://github.com/ahurford/school-test/blob/main/Preliminary_Results_School_Testing.pdf) We used the results of 4122 rapid antigen tests performed on January 22 and 25 to estimate that 2.7% of K-12 students in Newfoundland and Labrador were infected with COVID-19.

I am an external expert for PHAC's modelling group, and a member of the modelling special advisory group for the COVID Immunity Taskforce. I have provided modelling support to the Newfoundland and Labrador government throughout the pandemic.

### Prospective students {-}

I am always looking to support graduate students with a strong interest in mathematical biology, who are interested in deriving, analyzing, parameterizing and validating dynamical systems models in ecology and epidemiology.

If you are interested in becoming a graduate student in my lab, please identify some of my publications that are of interest to you, and how these relate to your future research interests. Please send me an email describing your qualifications and interests.
