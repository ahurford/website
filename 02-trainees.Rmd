# Trainees {-}

I am always looking to support graduate students with a strong interest in mathematical biology, who are interested in deriving, analyzing, parameterizing and validating dynamical systems models in ecology and epidemiology.

If you are interested in becoming a graduate student or postdoctoral fellow in my lab, please watch the [Society for Mathematical Biology Forum](https://smb.org/Member-Forum), the [Theoretical Ecology Wiki](http://esatheory.wikidot.com/start) for the Ecological Society of America, and the [Canadian Society for Ecology and Evolution](https://www.csee-scee.ca/category/jobs/) job listings, where I will advertise available positions during the month of October.
