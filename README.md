Joany: Take a look at the "making figures chapter", and also the "finding your way". I've started edits here on Yolanda's work. Take a look here and see what you think. If you like the style then keep editing this way (as I didn't get finished). If you have a better idea of how to do this, have a meeting with me to talk about how to do it. I think flushing out the subsection on debugging should be a priority.

Yolanda: I added quite a bit to your "making figures chapter", and also the "finding your way" chapter. Let me know what you think. I feel like we are nearly finished (?) I think we could probably move onto developing one lab for the BIOL 2000- core courses (!)... drawn from the carpentaries... a few exercises on clearing data with some topic-relevant data... (R packages and github are usually good for this)... could it be !?!
